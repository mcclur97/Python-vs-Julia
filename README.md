# Python-vs-Julia

The files within this repository are meant to test and compare the speeds of Python and Julia whilst doing the specific task of matrix multiplcation. In this repository there is a Python notebook and Julia file. Both of these files do automatic matrix multiplication of matrices from size 100x100 to 100,000x100,000 using their respective languages. This process is timed and recorded, the julia times are recorded and saved on to the "JuliaTimes.csv" file. These times are compared and a graphical representation is saved on to the "Speed_comparison.png".
